    1 ---<meta> Tag: The <meta> tag is used to provide metadata about the HTML document, such as the character encoding and viewport settings. The "charset" attribute sets the character encoding to UTF-8, which supports a wide range of characters from various languages. The "viewport" attribute adjusts the initial scale and width for better display on different devices, particularly mobile devices.

2--<title> Tag: The <title> tag is used to specify the title of the webpage. The text within this tag will be displayed in the browser's title bar or tab, helping users identify the page.

    3--<h1> and <h2> Tags: These are heading tags used to create hierarchical headings for content. <h1> represents the main heading, while <h2> represents a secondary heading. Headings provide structure to the content and improve accessibility.

4--<form> Tag: The <form> tag defines an HTML form that is used to collect user input. The "action" attribute specifies the URL to which the form data should be sent when the form is submitted. In this case, the attribute is left empty, so the form data won't be sent anywhere (it's often used for demonstration purposes).

    5--<input> Tag: The <input> tag is used to create various types of input fields within a form. The "type" attribute specifies the type of input field to create. In this code, "text" is used for a text input field, and "radio" is used for radio buttons.

6--name Attribute: The "name" attribute is used to assign a name to an input field. This name is used to identify the input when the form is submitted. It's important for differentiating between form elements.

    7--id Attribute: The "id" attribute is used to uniquely identify an HTML element. It's often used for styling, scripting, or referring to the element in a more specific manner.

8--<fieldset> Tag: The <fieldset> tag groups related form elements together. It's commonly used for grouping radio buttons or checkboxes that share a common purpose.

    9--<legend> Tag: The <legend> tag provides a caption or title for the content within the <fieldset> tag. It helps in describing the purpose of the grouped elements.

10--These HTML elements and attributes are used to structure and define the content of the webpage, capture user input, and provide meaningful context for both users and developers.-->



11-- Required Field: In the "Name" input field, the required attribute has been added. This attribute specifies that the field must be filled out before the form can be submitted.

Text Area: A textarea has been added for entering the user's address. The cols and rows attributes control the dimensions of the textarea.

Email Input: The "Email" input field now uses the type="email" attribute. This helps browsers validate the email format.

Number Input: The "Pincode" input field uses the type="number" attribute, which provides a numerical keypad on mobile devices.

Dropdown Select: The "Card Type" dropdown menu lets users select the type of card they're using for payment. Each card type is represented by an option in the <select> element.

Date Input: The "Expiration Date" field uses the type="date" attribute to display a date picker for selecting a date.

Password Input: The CVV field uses the type="password" attribute, which masks the entered text (for sensitive information like passwords).

Submit Button: A "Pay Now" submit button has been added to allow users to submit the form.
